Just change "SystemUI.apk" and "VegaHomeThemeClassic" in the existing Android path. **Access is only possible with root permission**.

If you want to change to the leather texture(Navigation Bar) shown in the image above, download folder 'SystemUI', extract file 'ic_systembar.zip', and replace the image with the same name.

After that, convert folder 'SystemUI' to apk and replace it with an original apk.
